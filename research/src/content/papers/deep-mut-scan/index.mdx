# Deep mutational scanning (DMS)

## Deep mutational scanning: a new style of protein science
- why DMS?
  - it is hard to predict which mutations will be most informative
- DMS requires an assay amenable to a **coupled genotype-phenotype platform**
- DMS applications
  - answer questions about evolution
    - how many paths can evolution take?
    - how many mutations are needed to cause a gain of function?
  - discover rare mutational variants
