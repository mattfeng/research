# Metal organic frameworks

export const CO2 = () => <>CO<sub>2</sub></>;

## The chemistry of MOFs for <CO2/> capture, regeneration, and conversion
- **<CO2 /> regeneration**. release of <CO2/> from the MOF
- **wt%**. percent by weight
- **clathrate**. a chemical consisting of a lattice that traps or contains molecules
- **reticular chemistry**. the design, functionalization, and structural variation of porous, crystalline, and extended solid materials
- four crucial developments in the past 25 years
  1. expansion of reticular chemistry
  2. marriage of molecular chemistry with framework chemistry
  3. discovery of ultra-high porosity
  4. the concept of "heterogeneity within order": structurally and chemically different components are brought together to function synergistically within a framework
- **PSA**. pressure swing adsorption
- **TSA**. temperature swing adsorption
- **VSA**. vacuum swing adsorption

### Criteria for post-combustion <CO2/> capture
- **adsorption**. the adhesion of atoms, ions or molecules from a gas, liquid or dissolved solid to a surface

#### Coordinatively unsaturated metal sites
- less important since water competitively adsorbs and is difficult to overcome

#### Heteroatoms
