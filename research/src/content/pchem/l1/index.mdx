# Lecture 1. Quantum mechanics: historical background, photoelectric effect, Compton scattering

## Light
- Properties of waves
  - refraction
  - diffraction
  - **interference effects**
- Properties of particles
  - kinetic energy, $T$
  - momentum, $\bf{p}$
- Photoelectric effect
  - Energy of a photon is $E = h\nu$
  - Work function: $\Phi = h\nu_0$
- Compton scattering
  - Gives evidence that **photons** have momentum
